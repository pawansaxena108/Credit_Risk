### Top 5 STAR Challenges – Credit Risk / Loan Default

1. **Challenge:** Logistic regression underperforming for high-risk borrowers.
   **Solution:** Engineered interaction and nonlinear features (Debt-to-Income, Loan-to-Value, squared income).
   **Result:** Improved recall for high-risk borrowers by 5% while keeping the model interpretable.

2. **Challenge:** Deep learning model seen as a “black box” by business stakeholders.
   **Solution:** Applied SHAP explanations to highlight feature importance and interactions, presenting clear visual insights.
   **Result:** Stakeholders gained confidence in model behavior and used insights to enhance logistic regression features.

3. **Challenge:** Predicted probabilities misaligned with observed defaults (poor calibration).
   **Solution:** Applied Platt scaling and isotonic regression; validated with calibration plots and Brier score.
   **Result:** Calibration improved significantly, increasing regulator and business trust.

4. **Challenge:** Portfolio drift caused model performance degradation over time.
   **Solution:** Implemented monitoring pipelines and retraining schedules using rolling window evaluation.
   **Result:** Maintained accuracy and calibration consistently, avoiding unexpected risk exposures.

5. **Challenge:** Limited ability to anticipate risk under changing economic conditions.
   **Solution:** Conducted stress testing and “what-if” simulations using model outputs to evaluate portfolio vulnerabilities.
   **Result:** Risk teams gained actionable insights without deploying complex models in production.

These 5 examples cover **feature engineering, deep learning explainability, calibration, model maintenance, and stress testing**, giving you a well-rounded set of STAR stories for interviews.

I can also **draft a 1–2 sentence “verbal version” for each** so you can narrate them smoothly in under 30 seconds per story.

Do you want me to do that?
